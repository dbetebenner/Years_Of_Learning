# Learning by the Year:

## On the idea of a year's worth of learning

The idea of "a year's worth of learning" is now new.  
## Using GitHub to building and distribute R packages [@dbetebenner](https://github.com/dbetebenner)

Perhaps the greatest strength of [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) is its extensibility. The ability to
create packages with R has led to the development of tens of thousands of speciality software packages
that expand base R in innumerable ways. Although building your first R package can be a daunting task,
doing so is well worth the effort: An R package adds fidelity to any data-related task and greatly tames
analytic complexity. In this demonstration, [Damian Betebenner](https://github.com/dbetebenner) presents how to quickly build
your first R package from a package skeleton on GitHub. Coupling R package development with a GitHub repository
has many advantages, including

* better code maintenance,
* easy distribution of the package to other users, and
* online documentation via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

The repo containing the package skeleton is located [here](https://github.com/dbetebenner/customizedPackageForR).

## Web-Based Distribution of Research using GitHub [@alliecooperman](https://github.com/alliecooperman)

GitHub allows users to collate their analyses into a user-friendly, distribution-ready website.
In this demonstration we show how to researchers can leverage [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and
author-written R packages (also available through GitHub), to host vignettes, source code for
statistical analyses, presentations, and project updates. Furthermore, researchers can easily customize the
website layout to match a desired style. Additionally, being web-hosted, all content is
immediately available with source code. In the demonstration, we present an example website
created during a summer internship program. We then walk through the basic set-up of a
skeleton website within RStudio, including how to incorporate new pages and structure the
webpage navigation. We also discuss the benefits of developing a project website for promoting collaboration
and reproducible research practices.

## Using GitHub and RMarkdown for report generation and dissemination [@adamvi](https://github.com/adamvi)

Data analysts are often tasked with writing reports that
describe data, analyses, and results associated with a project. Depending upon the nature of the
project, such reports are either completely customized or borrow heavily from other reports (e.g.,
annual reports). GitHub repositories and associated GitHub actions can be used to coordinate the
writing as well as the production of final reports for dissemination. The process we demonstrate
utilizes R, R Markdown, and several associated R packages as the base tools to construct these
reports.

## Using GitHub to consolodate the analysis and dissemination of research [@ndadey](https://github.com/ndadey)

Prior presentations have focused on creating a series of vignettes or write ups via R individual 
R markdown files linked through a webpage. This demonstration illustrates how researchers can use 
the r [bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/books.html) package to house more complex analyses. 
This approach may work well for projects that involve a number of interconnected analyses that need to be
run regularly. For example, state educational agencies could use this approach to house a series of analyses that are 
run and expanded on annually. Similarly, this approach could be used to house regular psychometric analyses conducted 
on annual test data.
