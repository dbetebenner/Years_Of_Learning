- Expressions relating amounts of learning to time (e.g., _a year's worth of learning_) have been around for a long time.[^1]
- These expressions often roll off the tongue and suggest something obvious -- something that everyone understands.[^2]
- Despite the commonsense facade, relating amount of learning to time conceals significant technical and conceptual issues.
- I would argue that the expression [__On grade level__]{style="color: red;"} is to [__attainment__]{style="color: blue;"} as [__a year's worth of learning__]{style="color: red;"} is to [__growth__]{style="color: blue;"}.

[^1]: When going through some old documents I found a [paper](https://github.com/CenterForAssessment/SGP_Resources/blob/master/articles/yearsgrowth.pdf){.external target="_blank"} and [presentation](https://github.com/CenterForAssessment/SGP_Resources/blob/master/presentations/yearsgrowth_presentation.pdf){.external target="_blank"} I wrote for AERA on the topic back in 2008 that I had completely forgotten about.

[^2]: Think of the expression _an honest day's work_.

- Communicating results to non-technical audiences requires trade-offs.
- The best solution from a technical perspective may be a communication failure from a practical perspective.
- Utility trumps validity.
- Are the shortcomings of expressions like _year's worth of learning_ so large as to make them counterproductive?
- One prominent researcher in the measurement field doesn't think so.

Section: Effect Size Years of Learning 
#########################################

# Effect Size

* Following @Yen:1986 and @DadeBrig:2012 cross-grade, effect size is defined as the standardized mean difference between _grade x content area_ 
means ($g1$ and $g2$) using the pooled standard deviation:

$$
\textsf{Effect Size} \equiv \frac{\overline{X}_{g1} - \overline{X}_{g2}}{\sqrt{\frac{\hat{ \sigma}^2_{g1} + \hat{ \sigma}^2_{g2}}{2}}}
$${#eq-effect-size}

* Note, in order for this mean difference in the numerator to make sense, we must have a scale (i.e., a vertical scale or developmental scale) that allows for the subtraction of scaled scores.
* The effect size quantifies the extent to which the mean has shifted between the two scaled score distributions. 
* There will be considerable overlap in the students in $g1$ and $g2$ in most applications of @eq-effect-size to state summative assessment data. However, there is no requirement that $g1$ and $g2$ consist of the same students (e.g., NAEP).

## Empirical results

:::{.incremental}
* We examine effect size increases for unmatched and matched cohorts of students using data from 4 states.
* All data are derived from assessment administrations occurring prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
* Using @eq-effect-size we calculate effect size changes for 1, 2, 3, and 4 years (provided enough years of data exist for the state).
* Depending upon the number of years of data we have for a state, we can calculate effect size changes across several cohorts of students. 
* Results are summarized in the following figures.

## Let's Summarize

:::{.incremental}
* The effect size approach to quantifying a year's worth of learning depends on:
  - the assessment that is administered,
  - the population of students to whom the assessment is administered,
  - the year in which the assessment is administered,
  - the content area of the assessment,
  - the grade level of the assessment, and
  - the psychometric design used to scale and construct the assessment.
  - Moreover, the calculated effect size is only a system level average and is not applicable for determinations of a year's worth of learning at the individual level.
* This list of dependencies is as bad as the list we'd put together for any indicator derived from assessments.

## How?

:::{.incremental}
* Year's worth of learning is implicitly a norm-referenced quantity based upon average student performance.
* As such, one can employ regression based approaches to better formalize the concept.
* Attempts to reduce a year's worth of learning to an effect size are a clumsy, scaled-based attempt to address the question.
* As a norm-referenced quantity, SGPs can be utilized to define a year's worth of learning to be 50th percentile growth. 
* This is consistent with the effect size approach to defining change and avoids all of the shortcomings mentioned.
* The next section explores the consequences of this.

# SGP & Years of Learning {background-image="images/measuring_tape.jpg" background-size="cover" background-position="right"}

:::{.incremental}
* We investigate the relationship between growth norms and year's of learning.
* To do so, we exploit the the properties of the vertical scale.
  - A vertical scale purports to produce a score scale capable of providing comparable, cross-grade, scaled scores for a given content area across the range of achievement.
  - For example, a vertical scale support scale score subtraction.
* The goal is to quantify year's of learning in terms of an SGP.
  - What SGP is associated with 2 years of learning?
  - What SGP is associated with 3 years of learning?
  - What SGP is associated with no learning (or zero years of learning).
:::


## Analyses

:::{.incremental}
* We examine the relationship between mean SGP and year's of learning using pre-pandemic, vertically scaled, pre-pandemic, longitudinal data from 4 states as follows: 
  - One year's growth (for a one year span of time) is defined as 50th percentile growth. This is a _normal_ SGP.
  - Two year's growth (in one year) is calculated empirically by running individual data spanning two years (e.g. grade 3 to 5 data) through one-year growth norms (e.g., grade 3 to 4 growth norms). 
  - Three year's growth (in one year) is calculated empirically by running individual data spanning three years (e.g. grade 3 to 6 data) through one-year growth norms (e.g., grade 3 to 4 growth norms).
  - No growth (in one year) is calculated by running individual data with no increase in scaled score through the one-year growth norms (e.g., grade 3 to 4 growth norms).
  - I also calculated half-year growth (in one year) by running individual data spanning a single year (e.g., grade 3 to 4 data) through two-year growth norms(e.g., grade 3 to 5 growth norms). 
* Results are summarized in the following figures.

## Back to the survey question

* Based upon the SGP analyses were you able to determine the correct answer to the question you answered?

## Startling results

* The results perplexed me when I ran the analyses a month ago. 
* How is it possible for 60 or more percent of students making at least a year's worth of learning to make two or more year's worth of learning.
  - Are vertical scales this corrupt?
  - Charlie DePascale called vertical scaling an interesting _parlor trick_.

# Summary thoughts (preliminary)

* Years of learning interpretations based upon effect-size calculations are a dead end.
* It's not clear whether extending the effect size approach to utilize growth norms leads to coherent results.
  - It's too easy to throw vertical scales under the bus. For adjacent grades, scaled scores should be close to exchangable. 
* The possibility that student learning could be so "explosive" after reaching the year of learning threshold could have huge implications for educating students.
* I want to believe there is a way to _approximately_ map learning rates to time.
